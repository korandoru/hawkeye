# Concurrency strategy:
#   github.workflow: distinguish this workflow from others
#   github.event_name: distinguish `push` event from `pull_request` event
#   github.event.number: set to the number of the pull request if `pull_request` event
#   github.run_id: otherwise, it's a `push` or `schedule` event, only cancel if we rerun the workflow
